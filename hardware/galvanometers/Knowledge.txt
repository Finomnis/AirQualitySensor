Voltmeter SO-45 AC 0-300V Round Analog Dial Panel Meter Voltmeter Gauge Black

- Current controlled meter
- max value: 1.13 mA
- voltage: 2.77V + 2.20k Resistor in Series
- internal resistance galvo: 250 Ohms
- Added 2.2kOhm resistor in series and existing 100uF cap in parallel, this should make it controllable via PWM

With a VCC of 3.3V, 2.77V can be reached with a PWM duty cycle of 84% (corrected to 86% after testing it out).
